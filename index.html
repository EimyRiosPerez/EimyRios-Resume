        <div class="subheading mb-5">CHASS UndeclaredðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello Everybody! My name is Eimy Rios and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of California Riverside. I am currently an undeclared major under the college of CHASS. I am a first generation college student in search of not just a career but also of an experience. I am the daughter of parents who migrated to the United states for a better opportunity. My childhood was a joyous memory, for I  was fortunate enough to grow up and be raised by loving parents and siblings. I would like to say that my childhood was all glitz and glamor but it was not. As a young I experienced situations of non-well living conditions, I moved around quite a handful times. Although such experiences were very depressing to endure at the moment, it was truly experiences like such that helped open my eyes into a world of not just love. For the longest time I have been interested in why life is the way that it isâ€“ and not just in a political or economic stance, but philosophical. Thus the major that I am considering declaring is Philosophy. Philosophy is beyond interesting to me, for concepts of ethics, morality, kindness, and even the study of evil behaviors are discussed. Other than being interested in philosophy, I am enthusiast about learning and growing everyday. <br><br>

        I take pleasure in reading books and gaining new perspectives as well. Conversing with my family, friends, and peers is one of my favorite things to do ever. Over the years, I have learned how to become a great conversationalist and such traits have become part of my personality. Conversing with others is not only good for networking, but it is also good for gaining new perspectives, getting to meet new people, and articulating clearer speaking structures.<br><br>

        If there is something else about myself that not most people know about is that I love to travel. I started traveling at the age of twelve(my first trip being the state of Nevada) and ever since then, I fell in love. Traveling can be a very expensive luxury, however, when I get the opportunity to do so I take it up. I have traveled to my loving country of Mexico many times and within the states, such as Hawaii. Visiting such places has not only allowed me to experience tourist places, but they have aided me in opening my eyes to new cultures, foods, perspectives, beliefs, and more. It is quite beautiful to see so many people alive and within their home countries and states, but it is also so sad to see that not everyone's living conditions are the same. When and where I travel makes me put into perspective my life and how grateful I am for the life that I live. I love the life that I am currently living, for I am happyâ€“ that is not always the case because I am human, but still even when at my darkest, I always try to find the light. I am only one year into my academic career here at UCR and I have three more to go. I look forward to learning, growing, and experiencing whatever life has in store for me.
